// ASSESSMENT 2: JAVASCRIPT FOUNDATIONS
// Coding practical questions

// 1. Write an arrow function that takes a number as an argument and decides if the number is evenly divisble by three or not. Use the test cases 15, 0, 385, -7. Expected output: "15 is divisible by three", "0 is divisible by three", "385 is not divisble by three", "-7 is not divisble by three".



// 2. Create an object called helloMe. Include your firstName, lastName and TWO OTHER properties of you. Add a method to your object that will return a sentence using the object properties to describe you.



// -------------------------------------------------
// Consider the variable:

var randomNouns = ["streetlamp", "potato", "teeth", "conclusion", "nephew", "temperature", "database"]

// 3a. Write a function that returns every other item as one string. Expected output: "streetlamp teeth nephew database"



// 3b. Create an arrow function that takes in the variable and returns an array with the number of letters in each string. Expected output: [10, 6, 5, 10, 6, 11, 8]



// 3c. Stretch: Create a function called capitalizer that takes in the variable and returns the array with all the words capitalized. Expected output: ["Streetlamp", "Potato", "Teeth", "Conclusion", "Nephew", "Temperature", "Database"]



// -------------------------------------------------
// Consider the variables:
var testString1 = "learn"
var testString2 = "academy"
var testString3 = "sandiego"

// 4a. Write a function called alphabetSoup that takes one argument and returns a string with all the letters in alphabetical order. Use each of the varibales as test cases. Expected output: "aelnr" "aacdemy" "adeginos"



// 4b. Write a function that takes in all three variables and returns a string with all the letters in alphabetical order. Expected output: "aaaacddeeegilmnnorsy"



// -------------------------------------------------
// Consider the variables:
var amounts = [9, 1, 8, 16, 5, 1, 42]
var animals = ["ducks", "elephants", "pangolins", "zebras", "giraffes", "penguins", "llamas"]

// 5a. Write a function that takes the two variables and returns a combined string. Expected output: "9 ducks 1 elephants 8 pangolins 16 zebras 5 giraffes 1 penguins 42 llamas"



// 5b. Stretch: Create a function that combines the two variables and updates the animal to be singular if the animal's corresponding number is 1. Expected output: "9 ducks 1 elephant 8 pangolins 16 zebras 5 giraffes 1 penguin 42 llamas"
